## About The Project

This project was built to explore the relationship between public sentiment, as reflected in news media, and the financial performance of publicly traded stocks. In today's information-driven market, understanding the narrative around a company is crucial for making informed investment decisions. This tool automates the process of gathering and analyzing this sentiment data.

The application allows a user to enter any valid US stock ticker symbol. It then fetches a multitude of recent news articles from around the web, processes the text of these articles to determine the overall sentiment, and presents the findings in a comprehensive, interactive dashboard. The final goal is to visually correlate the calculated sentiment trends with the stock's historical price and volume data to uncover potential patterns.
